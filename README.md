# zdsfetch
An alternative for neofetch and fastfetch
Dependencies:
Linux or other UNIX-Like OS. Windows not supported.
Works best on Linux and BSD. Other OS marked as unknown
sh (usually pre-installed on unix-like os)
Build instructions:
Clone repo:
git clone https://github.com/diabloblacno/zdsfetch
cd into it
cd zdsfetch
compile main
sh zdsfetch
copy it to /bin and /sbin (/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin on BSD)
cp zdsfetch /bin /sbin
Oh My ZSH users have to rename cloned repository, otherwise it will change directory, not show fetch.
Now it's ready to go!
